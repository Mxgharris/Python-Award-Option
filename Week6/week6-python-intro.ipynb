    "### Week 6: File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "- Learn how to open, read, write, and append to text files.\n",
    "- Understand different file access modes: `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions while working with files.\n",
    "- Use file operations to store and retrieve persistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Opening and Closing Files:\n",
    "- Use the `open()` function to open a file.\n",
    "- Always close files after use or use `with open()` for automatic closing.\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    file = open(\"filename.txt\", \"mode\")\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Using `with` for automatic closing**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open(\"filename.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Reading Files:\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire file.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all lines into a list.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Writing to Files:\n",
    "- `'w'` mode creates a new file or overwrites an existing file.\n",
    "- `'a'` mode appends to an existing file without deleting its contents.\n",
    "- You can use `file.write()` or `print()` with `file=` to write data to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using `write()`**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"Hello, world!\\n\")\n",
    "        file.write(\"This is a new line.\\n\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using `print()` to Write to a File**:\n",
    "    - `print()` provides automatic newline handling and formatting.\n",
    "    - **Example**:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "            print(\"Hello, world!\", file=file)\n",
    "            print(\"This is another way to write to a file.\", file=file)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - This method ensures that each `print()` statement writes to a new line automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appending to Files:\n",
    "- `'a'` mode adds data to an existing file.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open(\"example.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"\\nNew line added!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Reading and Writing CSV Files:\n",
    "- CSV files store tabular data in text format.\n",
    "- Use the `csv` module to read and write CSV files.\n",
    "- **Reading a CSV File**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import csv\n",
    "    with open(\"data.csv\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "        for row in reader:\n",
    "            print(row)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Writing to a CSV File**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open(\"data.csv\", \"w\", newline=\"\") as file:\n",
    "        writer = csv.writer(file)\n",
    "        writer.writerow([\"Name\", \"Age\"])\n",
    "        writer.writerow([\"Alice\", 25])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Handling Exceptions in File Handling:\n",
    "- Use `try-except` blocks to handle file errors.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(\"nonexistent.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "            content = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: File not found.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
