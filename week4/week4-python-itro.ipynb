    "### Week 4: Data Structures â€“ Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the purpose and basic operations of lists, dictionaries, and tuples.\n",
    "- Learn how to iterate over and search these data structures.\n",
    "- Use these data structures to solve practical programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lists:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ordered, mutable collections that can store elements of any type.\n",
    "- **Common Operations**:\n",
    "  - Add items: `list.append(item)`\n",
    "  - Remove items: `list.remove(item)`\n",
    "  - Access items by index: `list[index]`\n",
    "  - **Iteration**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for item in my_list:\n",
    "        print(item)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Search**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if search_item in my_list:\n",
    "        print(\"Found:\", search_item)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    my_list.append(4)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "    print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "    for item in my_list:\n",
    "        print(item)  # Iterates through the list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dictionaries:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Collections of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value.\n",
    "- **Common Operations**:\n",
    "  - Add or update key-value pairs: `dict[key] = value`\n",
    "  - Access values by key: `dict[key]`\n",
    "  - Remove key-value pairs: `del dict[key]`\n",
    "  - **Iteration**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Search**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if search_key in my_dict:\n",
    "        print(\"Found:\", my_dict[search_key])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "    print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "    my_dict[\"age\"] = 26     # Updates age to 26\n",
    "    for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")  # Iterates through dictionary\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Tuples:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ordered, immutable collections of elements.\n",
    "- **Common Operations**:\n",
    "  - Access items by index: `tuple[index]`\n",
    "  - Use tuples to return multiple values from a function.\n",
    "  - **Iteration**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "        print(item)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - **Search**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if search_item in my_tuple:\n",
    "        print(\"Found:\", search_item)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2\n",
    "    for item in my_tuple:\n",
    "        print(item)  # Iterates through tuple\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returning Multiple Values from a Function:\n",
    "- When a function returns more than one value, the returned result is automatically stored as a tuple.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def get_stats(numbers):\n",
    "        total = sum(numbers)\n",
    "        count = len(numbers)\n",
    "        average = total / count\n",
    "        return total, count, average  # Returns a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = get_stats([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "    print(result)  # Output: (60, 3, 20.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Accessing individual values from the returned tuple\n",
    "    total, count, average = result\n",
    "    print(f\"Total: {total}, Count: {count}, Average: {average}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Key Points**:\n",
    "  - The `return` statement with multiple values creates a tuple.\n",
    "  - You can unpack the tuple into separate variables for clarity."
