    "### Week 5: Validation and Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lesson Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the importance of input validation and error handling.\n",
    "- Learn how to use `try-except` to handle errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "- Implement basic input validation techniques to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- Combine these skills with concepts from previous weeks to write more robust programs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Input Validation**\n",
    "### Why Validate Input?\n",
    "- Prevents invalid or unexpected data from causing errors.\n",
    "- Ensures data integrity (e.g., no negative scores in a test result).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Validation Example**\n",
    "- Looping until a valid integer is entered:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        user_input = input(\"Enter a positive number: \")\n",
    "        if user_input.isdigit():  # Checks if input is a number\n",
    "            number = int(user_input)\n",
    "            if number > 0:\n",
    "                break\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                print(\"Number must be positive.\")\n",

    "## **2. Error Handling with `try-except`**\n",
    "### Why Use `try-except`?\n",
    "- Prevents program crashes when errors occur.\n",
    "- Allows for user-friendly error messages instead of system errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Error Handling Example**\n",
    "- Handling invalid number input:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            number = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",

    "## **3. Combining Validation and Error Handling**\n",
    "- Ensuring input is valid and handling unexpected errors:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "            if age <= 0:\n",
    "                print(\"Age must be a positive number.\")\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                break  # Exit loop if valid input is given\n",
